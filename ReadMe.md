# Country Clustering

## About
This is our Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on clustering analysis on countries data.  

## Problem statement

<b>Real world problem</b><br>
We are a Non-Governmental Organisation seeking to roll out a new programme to reform and help underdeveloped countries to progress.  Due to budget. constraints, we need to strategically determine which countries to assist. Hence, we aim to identify the countries that are performing poorly in areas beyond just GDP per capita. These areas include healthcare, education, access to necessities etc.  

<b>Data science problem</b><br>
Identify a cluster of countries that are underdeveloped in multiple areas based on a comprehensive set of indicators.
